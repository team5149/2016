# 2016-test
Simple test, just want to deploy and check that something will run. 

Curious about deploying and debugging. 

# Setup
1. Downloaded and installed ubuntu 14.04 lts into a vm 
2. Got git, build-essential + vim and plugins
3. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/team5149/2016-test`
4. Ran build.sh from the root directory. This will fetch the FRC tool chain and libaries then compile your code
5. Done

Check out [team 612](https://github.com/Chantilly612Code/), pulled build scripts from them. Plus they have some code examples.
